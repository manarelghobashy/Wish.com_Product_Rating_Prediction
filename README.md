# Wish.com_Product_Rating_Prediction
## Data Mining

The dataset is the wish.com product dataset. Some noises are added to the dataset. The goal is to predict the product ratings given the other features known for a product on Wish.com. Ratings are in categories from 1 to 5. For one product, the higher the rating is, the more the customers like the product. In this way, when you have a new product to be put on wish.com, you can estimate how likely people will like your product, without actually listing out there. Also, by doing this, it helps us to understand under what certain conditions a product will be highly rated, as a way to understand the customer base of wish.com.

## Steps:
- First, reading and preprocessing the data.
- Second, selecting features and preparing them for models.
- Third, build different models to predict the rating perfectly.
- fourth, prepare testing data.
- finally, predict the rating.

## models used:
- Decision tree with 3 different hyperparameter combinations.
- Support vector machines with two different hyperparameter combinations.
- Gaussian naive Bayes model.
- random forest classifier with two different hyperparameters combination.
